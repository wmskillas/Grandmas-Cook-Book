# Grandma's Cook Book

### Designed by:

    Elizabeth Billings    Sebastian Chunley      Amy Lightfoot       William Skillas

### Description

```md
To store family recipes in clean, organized application where you can share your favorites with friends. No more scrolling through life stories to get to the directions. There is no need to keep loose papers that will get ruined by olive oil or butter. All recipes are contained in one space where you can edit ingredients, ratios, or directions without having to scratch out and scribble on the side.

- Motivation for development
  Family reunions are a summer staple, and family get-togethers are always prime time for sharing recipes and remembering family traditions through them.

- User Story
  As a family member, I want to be able to share recipes and add additional recipes for future generations.
